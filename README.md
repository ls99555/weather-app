# Weather App

**üåê Live Demo**: [https://weather-app-one-tau-91.vercel.app](https://weather-app-one-tau-91.vercel.app)

A modern weather application that allows users to search for weather information in different cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

- üå§Ô∏è Search weather by city name
- üå°Ô∏è Display current temperature, humidity, wind speed
- üåßÔ∏è Rain information
- üì± Responsive design with SCSS modules
- üåì Light/Dark theme support
- üì≤ iPhone notch and safe area support
- ‚ôø Accessibility compliant
- ‚ö° Built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript
- üé® Professional design system with SCSS variables

## Getting Started

First, set up your environment variables:

1. Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
3. Add your API key:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

Then, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### Quick Deployment Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub** (already done! ‚úÖ)
2. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Import your `ls99555/weather-app` repository
3. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` with your API key
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` with your deployed URL
4. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app!

### Alternative Deployment Options:
- **Netlify**: Import from GitHub and add environment variables
- **Railway**: Connect GitHub repo and set environment variables
- **Digital Ocean App Platform**: Deploy directly from GitHub

## CV Project Points

This project demonstrates key frontend development skills:

‚Ä¢ **AI-Assisted Development**: Used GitHub Copilot to speed up initial development, then rewrote and adapted the generated code to fit my coding style and project needs. This taught me how to work with different code patterns and improved my ability to review and refactor code effectively.

‚Ä¢ **CSS Migration Project**: Took an existing Tailwind-based project and completely rebuilt the styling system using SCSS modules. Created my own design system with CSS variables for themes and made sure everything worked perfectly on mobile devices, including iPhones with notches.

‚Ä¢ **Custom Layout Work**: Modified AI-generated layouts extensively to match my vision for the app. Built responsive breakpoints from scratch, implemented mobile-first design, and learned different approaches to CSS organization while making the interface look exactly how I wanted.

‚Ä¢ **Full Production Deployment**: Took the project all the way to production on Vercel, including creating custom weather icons, adding proper SEO, building legal pages, and optimizing performance. The app is live and fully functional for real users.

‚Ä¢ **Real API Integration**: Connected to OpenWeatherMap's API with proper TypeScript typing, handled all the error cases (network issues, bad responses, missing data), and made sure users get helpful feedback when things go wrong. Also learned proper environment variable security.
